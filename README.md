Pocket Budget is a simple personal finance management app that enables you to enter and delete transactions as required. These modifications are immediately reflected in the "Total Balance" menu. Additionally, users can monitor the percentage of the amount spent through the progress bar.

This app has been developed using React JS and React Hooks, including React Context, and features local storage. The app's design is styled with CSS Grid Layout and Flexbox, making it mobile responsive.
